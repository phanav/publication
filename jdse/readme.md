Abstract:

Efficient learning from limited amount of data is crucial for machine learning.
One way to tackle this is transfer learning by transferring knowledge learned from a large source dataset, to a smaller target dataset. However, this often leads to severe overfitting. Alternatively, meta-leaning algorithms are designed to learn efficiently in the low data regime. We present a technique to reduce overfitting while fine-tuning a pre-trained model, along with a comparison of transfer learning and meta-learning for few-shot image classification in multiple domains.
