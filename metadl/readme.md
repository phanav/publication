Meta-learning competition at NeurIPS 2021

Abstract

Meta-learning is an important machine learning paradigm leveraging experience from previous tasks to make better predictions on the task at hand. The proposed challenge focuses on supervised learning, and more particularly few shot learning classification settings, aiming at learning a good model from very few examples, typically 1 to 5 per class.
We will include various datasets from healthcare, ecology, biology, and chemistry. By using datasets from these practical domains, we aim to maximize the humanitarian and societal impact. The competition will consist of three phases: a public phase, a feedback phase, and a final phase. The last two phases will be run with code submissions, fully blind-tested on the Codalab challenge platform. A single (final) submission will be evaluated during the final phase, using five fresh datasets, previously unknown to the meta-learning community. Together with the public datasets and feed-back datasets, the datasets, formatted in a uniform manner for this competition, will constitute a long-lasting valuable resource for research in this field. The scientific and technical questions addressed by this challenge include scalability, robustness to domain diversity, influence of pre-training as a form of transfer learning, and effectiveness of episodic meta-learning (from many small tasks).
